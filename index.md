<h2 class="page-heading">üëãüèº Hi, I'm Cory</h2>

  <p>
    I'm a Product Manager at <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> leading personalization and recommendation teams. We use AI and LLM's to connect users with the most relevant & informative video content.

  <p>
    Before Google I worked at <a href="https://everfi.com/">EVERFI</a>, builing K12 educational tools used by millions of teachers and students all over the globe. Prior to that I was a consultant, growing the federal hiring force at <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/">USAJOBS</a> and improving hotel stays at <a href="https://www.marriott.com/default.mi">Marriott</a>.

    I keep my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corybenavente/">LinkedIn</a> up-to-date, post occassionally on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/corybees/">Instagram</a>, and enjoy long walks on the beach.

  <p>
    I live in the Bay Area with my wife MJ and our son Remi.

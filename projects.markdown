<h2 class="page-heading">üõ†Ô∏è My Projects</h2>

My <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corybenavente/">LinkedIn</a> covers professional work. Below are some personal projects I've done over the past few years

### **Personal Site**
* **Goal:** Vibe-code a brief overview (i.e. this site) of my professional career and personal interests
* **Tech Stack/Tools:** <a href="https://gemini.google.com/app">Gemini</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>
* **Key Learnings:** 
	* I used Gemini 2.5 Flash for most of this project so the below learnings are based on 2.5 Flash. For the next project, I'll use Gemini 2.5 Pro for deeper reasoning and complexity.
	* AI tools are great for getting started, but as the files get more complex the tools lose context and more manual intervention is needed.
	* As complexity increases, breaking out chunks of the code (rather than the whole file) gets better responses. I assume more sophisticated tools handle longer context windows better (or doing this with Pro rather than Flash models).
	* Jekyll is lightweight and easy to use. The templates are much more suited for blogs with recurring posts against a non-changing structure so in the future, for non-blogs, I'd explore other options.

### **Reading Tracker**
* **Goal:** Better understand my explicit and implicit reading habits.
* **Tech Stack/Tools:** <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books?hl=en_US">Play Books</a>, <a href="https://workspace.google.com/products/sheets/">Google Sheets</a>, <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/overview">Looker Studio</a>
* **Key Learnings:** 
	* I've read <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/b304be4b-90ed-4562-88f3-aa0ebb25e683">19k pages</a> over the past 3 years (some more enjoyable than others)
	* Reading pace is not a trustworthy indicator of how much I liked the book. When I look at my highest rated books, <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/b304be4b-90ed-4562-88f3-aa0ebb25e683">pace is all over the map</a>.
	* My average daily pages for fiction books is <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/b304be4b-90ed-4562-88f3-aa0ebb25e683">~6.5 pages faster</a> than my average daily pages for non-fiction.

### **Fitness Tracking**
* **Goal:** Better understand my explicit and implicit fitness habits.
* **Tech Stack/Tools:** <a href="https://store.google.com/category/watches_trackers?hl=en-US">Fitbit</a>, <a href="https://workspace.google.com/products/sheets/">Google Sheets</a>, <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/overview">Looker Studio</a>
* **Key Learnings:** 
	* My avg run from 2023 - now is <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/755971ba-a91c-4b79-a7f9-64fef681cb26">3.47 miles</a>, but my daily runs in 2025 are much longer. My avg distance is slowly increasing as I've been pushing myself on distance the past few months.
	* I assumed my heaviest run day would be Saturdays or Sundays, however <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/755971ba-a91c-4b79-a7f9-64fef681cb26">Fridays</a> are when I've run the most. I guess I've been doing more on Fridays to decompress from the week ü´†
	* My running starts to get more <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/755971ba-a91c-4b79-a7f9-64fef681cb26">sporadic throughout 2024</a> then really <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/755971ba-a91c-4b79-a7f9-64fef681cb26">stretches out in mid-2025</a>. This coincides with the birth of my son and family coming in and out to help with baby ‚ù§Ô∏è
